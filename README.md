## Overview

Welcome to the **Introduction to Game Development Workshop**! This workshop is tailored for beginners who are eager to learn the fundamentals of game development. By the end of the session, you'll have created a simple game and gained a solid understanding of how to continue building on these skills.

## Workshop Objectives

By participating in this workshop, you will:
1. **Understand** the key concepts of game development, such as game loops, sprites, and collision detection.
2. **Set up** a game development environment using [INSERT TOOL HERE] (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot).
3. **Create** a basic 2D game.
4. **Learn** to control characters and objects in a game world.
5. **Implement** game mechanics like player input, scoring, and win/loss conditions.
6. **Test and debug** your game for functionality.
7. **Feel confident** in your ability to explore more advanced game development topics.

## Quick Start ðŸš€
